		<center><h3>Food Writing Recipes Looking For a New Home!</center></h3>
		
		<h4><p>I used to write recipes for Examiner.com. I was the New York City Budget Meals Examiner. I wrote simple, affordable meals for the busy average person with budget constraints. Most meals I created would cost between $50-$75 to buy all the ingredients and they would last a single person at least four days.</p></h4>
		<br>
		<h4><p>It was really fun creating meals on the fly and gave me a new hobby which I continue to this day. Plus we had to take our own photos so I got seriously into photography. I’m still not great at it but it is another pastime that I have. Yes I’m one of those sunset photo takers.</p></h4>

		<h4><p>Well Examiner was taken down and I have to find a new place to post my recipes. No fear though on new experiences. I will start reposting the old recipes here while I search out a new place to publish new recipes.</p></h4>

		<center><h3>Fresh and Flavorful Pasta, Basil, Tomatoes</h3></center>

		<article><h4><p>Some of the best recipes are happy accidents. I was cleaning my bedroom and clearing a stack of papers off my desk when I noticed that one of them had a handwritten recipe on it. I have no idea where it came from but judging from the ingredients I was game to eat. Initially I tried this recipe with linguine but decided to experiment with different pastas when the grocery store near me had a sale. I found that Penne and Rigatoni’s ridges picked up the spices and held onto the flavors better than the linguini did.</p></h4>
	<ul>
		<li>1lb Rigatoni or Penne pasta</li> 
		<li>3 Tlb Olive oil</li>
		<li>1 red onion diced </li>
		<li>3 cloves fresh garlic smashed </li>
		<li>4-5 Italian sausages casings removed (I prefer the Italian sausage because the spices add to the flavor of the dish)</li>
		<li>1 pint cherry tomatoes</li> 
		<li>2 Tlb red wine vinegar</li>
		<li>3/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
		<li>1/4 tsp black pepper </li>
		<li>1/4 cup arugula </li>
		<li>1/2 cup fresh basil</li>
		<li>Parmesan to taste </li>
	</ul>
		<br>
		<p><h4>Cook pasta al dente and set aside.</h></p>

		<h4><p>Heat oil in a large sauce pan, add onions and garlic. Cook until onion is translucent. Add sausage with the casing removed. (I just discovered that they don’t sell the sausage filling uncased and the price is competitive with that of the regular sausage.)</p></h4>
		<h4><p>Add tomatoes and cook until they burst in the pan. Add vinegar, salt and pepper. Mix well in the pan. </p></h4>
		<h4><p>Add about half of the pasta to the pot. Mix. Add the Basil last. Turn off and place half the pasta on top of some arugula. </p></h4>
		<h4><p>Grate some fresh parmesan on top of the pasta mixture. Mangia and Enjoy! This recipe is can’t miss!</p></h4>
