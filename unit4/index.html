		<h4><p>I used to write recipes for Examiner.com. I was the New York City Budget Meals Examiner. I wrote simple, affordable meals for the busy average person with budget constraints. Most meals I created would cost between $50-$75 to buy all the ingredients and they would last a single person at least four days.</p></h4>
		<br>
		<h4><p>It was really fun creating meals on the fly and gave me a new hobby which I continue to this day. Plus we had to take our own photos so I got seriously into photography. I’m still not great at it but it is another pastime that I have. Yes I’m one of those sunset photo takers.</p></h4>

		<center><h3>Fresh and Flavorful Pasta, Basil, with Tomatoes</h3></center>

		<article><h4><p>Some of the best recipes are happy accidents. I was cleaning my bedroom and clearing a stack of papers off my desk when I noticed that one of them had a handwritten recipe on it. I have no idea where it came from but judging from the ingredients I was game to eat. Initially I tried this recipe with linguine but decided to experiment with different pastas when the grocery store near me had a sale. I found that Penne and Rigatoni’s ridges picked up the spices and held onto the flavors better than the linguini did.</p></h4>
	<ul>
		<li>1lb Rigatoni or Penne pasta</li> 
		<li>3 Tlb Olive oil</li>
		<li>1 red onion diced </li>
		<li>3 cloves fresh garlic smashed </li>
		<li>4-5 Italian sausages casings removed (I prefer the Italian sausage because the spices add to the flavor of the dish)</li>
		<li>1 pint cherry tomatoes</li> 
		<li>2 Tlb red wine vinegar</li>
		<li>3/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
		<li>1/4 tsp black pepper </li>
		<li>1/4 cup arugula </li>
		<li>1/2 cup fresh basil</li>
		<li>Parmesan to taste </li>
	</ul>
		<br>
		<p><h4>Cook pasta al dente and set aside.</h></p>

		<h4><p>Heat oil in a large sauce pan, add onions and garlic. Cook until onion is translucent. Add sausage with the casing removed. (I just discovered that they don’t sell the sausage filling uncased and the price is competitive with that of the regular sausage.)</p></h4>
		<h4><p>Add tomatoes and cook until they burst in the pan. Add vinegar, salt and pepper. Mix well in the pan. </p></h4>
		<h4><p>Add about half of the pasta to the pot. Mix. Add the Basil last. Turn off and place half the pasta on top of some arugula. </p></h4>
		<h4><p>Grate some fresh parmesan on top of the pasta mixture. Mangia and Enjoy! This recipe is can’t miss!</p></h4>

		<h4>Summer is upon us which means two things, one, it is too hot to turn on the oven and two, salads are at their apex of deliciousness. While I was walking the aisles of my local supermarket, I walked past a can of chickpeas and for some reason I grabbed it and put it in my cart along with some black beans. I had an idea.</h4>

		“Lets make a Greek type salad I thought.”

	<article>
		<h4>So I bought what in my mind were Greek seeming ingredients and set about making a sort of Greek salad.</h4>

	<center>Ingredients:</center>

		For the Dressing:
	<ul>
		<li>4 cloves diced garlic (less if you are sensitive to the strength of garlic but honestly the more the merrier!</li>
		<li>3 Tablespoons of Lemon juice (1 fresh lemon)</li>
		<li>6 Tablespoons of Lime juice (2 fresh Limes)</li>
		<li>3 Tablespoons of Olive Oil plus more to taste</li>
		<li>¼ cup minced fresh Basil or 1/3 cup dried basil</li>
		<li>1 Tablespoon chopped Parsley</li>
		<li>1 Teaspoon Honey</li>
		<li>Salt (to taste)</li>
		<li>Pepper</li>
		<li>¼ Teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
		<li>Dash Mint</li>
		<li>Dash Oregano</li>
	</ul>
<br>
	<ul>
		<li>For the Salad:
		<li>1 Can Chickpeas, drained</li>
		<li>1 Can Black beans, drained</li>
		<li>1.5 Cup diced onion (red onion is less aggressive)</li>
		<li>1 Pint grape Tomatoes or 1 large vine ripened Tomato, diced</li>
		<li>4 sweet peppers (Red, Yellow, Orange) seeded and diced</li>
	</ul>
<br>
	<p>Start by whisking the dressing ingredients. Taste your dressing and add more of whatever seems to be lacking. Typically that’s salt but I found that I needed more cayenne and oregano too. 

	<br>Place the chickpeas, black beans, diced red onion, diced tomatoes, and diced peppers in a separate bowl. Toss with the dressing to coat and let sit for about an hour to really get the flavors mixing. Serve with a nice lamb chop or alone, your choice.

	Mangia and enjoy!</article>
