			<h3>Food Writing Recipes Looking For A New Home</h3>

			<h4>I used to write recipes for Examiner.com. I was the New York City Budget Meals Examiner. I wrote simple, affordable meals for the busy average person with budget constraints. Most meals I created would cost between $50-$75 to buy all the ingredients and they would last a single person at least four days.</h4>
			<h4><p>Some of the best recipes are happy accidents. I was cleaning my bedroom and clearing a stack of papers off my desk when I noticed that one of them had a handwritten recipe on it. I have no idea where it came from but judging from the ingredients I was game to eat. Initially I tried this recipe with linguine but decided to experiment with different pastas when the grocery store near me had a sale. I found that Penne and Rigatoni’s ridges picked up the spices and held onto the flavors better than the linguini did.</p></h4>

			<h4><p>It was really fun creating meals on the fly and gave me a new hobby which I continue to this day. Plus we had to take our own photos so I got seriously into photography. I’m still not great at it but it is another pastime that I have. Yes I’m one of those sunset photo takers, but I also take all the photos for my recipes.</p>

			<h4>Summer is upon us which means two things, one, it is too hot to turn on the oven and two, salads are at their apex of deliciousness. While I was walking the aisles of my local supermarket, I walked past a can of chickpeas and for some reason I grabbed it and put it in my cart along with some black beans. I had an idea.</h4>
    
			“Lets make a salad with greek ingredients," I thought.”

			<h4>So I bought what in my mind were Greek seeming ingredients and set about making a sort of Greek salad.</h4>

			<h4>Ingredients:</h4>

			<h4>For the Dressing:
				<ul>
				<li>4 cloves diced garlic (less if you are sensitive to the strength of garlic but honestly the more the merrier!</li>
				<li>3 Tablespoons of Lemon juice (1 fresh lemon)</li>
				<li>6 Tablespoons of Lime juice (2 fresh Limes)</li>
				<li>3 Tablespoons of Olive Oil plus more to taste</li>
				<li>¼ cup minced fresh Basil or 1/3 cup dried basil</li>
				<li>1 Tablespoon chopped Parsley</li>
				<li>1 Teaspoon Honey</li>
				<li>Salt (to taste)</li>
				<li>Pepper</li>
				<li>¼ Teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
				<li>Dash Mint</li>
				<li>Dash Oregano</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>For the Salad:
				<li>1 Can Chickpeas, drained</li>
				<li>1 Can Black beans, drained</li>
				<li>1.5 Cup diced onion (red onion is less aggressive)</li>
				<li>1 Pint grape Tomatoes or 1 large vine ripened Tomato, diced</li>
				<li>4 sweet peppers (Red, Yellow, Orange) seeded and diced</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Start by whisking the dressing ingredients. Taste your dressing and add more of whatever seems to be lacking. Typically that’s salt but I found that I needed more cayenne and oregano too. 

			<h4>Place the chickpeas, black beans, diced red onion, diced tomatoes, and diced peppers in a separate bowl. Toss with the dressing to coat and let sit for about an hour to really get the flavors mixing. Serve with a nice lamb chop or alone, your choice.

			Mangia and enjoy!
