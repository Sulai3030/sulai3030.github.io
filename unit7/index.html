				<h4><p>I am an editor and writer with book, blogging, recipe, online and E-publishing experience. I have an MFA in Writing from The New School University in New York City and a Certificate in Publishing from Emerson College.</h4></p>

				<h4><p>Well Examiner was taken down and I have to find a new place to post my recipes. No fear though on new experiences. I will start reposting the old recipes here while I search out a new place to publish new recipes.</p></h4>

				<h4>I discovered programming a while back and now I am enthralled. There is so much you can do with it! Look at this button!</h4>

				<h4>I used to write recipes for Examiner.com. I was the New York City Budget Meals Examiner. I wrote simple, affordable meals for the busy average person with budget constraints. Most meals I created would cost between $50-$75 to buy all the ingredients and they would last a single person at least four days.</h4>
				<h4><p>Some of the best recipes are happy accidents. I was cleaning my bedroom and clearing a stack of papers off my desk when I noticed that one of them had a handwritten recipe on it. I have no idea where it came from but judging from the ingredients I was game to eat. Initially I tried this recipe with linguine but decided to experiment with different pastas when the grocery store near me had a sale. I found that Penne and Rigatoni’s ridges picked up the spices and held onto the flavors better than the linguini did.</p></h4>

				<h4><p>It was really fun creating meals on the fly and gave me a new hobby which I continue to this day. Plus we had to take our own photos so I got seriously into photography. I’m still not great at it but it is another pastime that I have. Yes I’m one of those sunset photo takers, but I also take all the photos for my recipes.</p>
