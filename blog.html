	<article><p>CRONOCRIMINES AKATIMECRIMES
JULY 21, 2015 LEAVE A COMMENT EDIT
People who know me know sci-fi and in particular I love time travel movies. I love The Terminator because its concept of time travel is pretty grounded. Well as much as a movie about robots that travel back in time to kill humans to avert a coming machine-human war can be.</p>

<p>And I love Looper, honestly I just love Rian Johnson movies, he’s the only reason I am going to watch Star Wars (haven’t we all been burned enough?)</p>

 
<p>And I particularly love Primer (see my effusive preview of Upstream Color is HERE based solely on how awesome I thought Primer was. Primer is one of my favorite movies that I just found somewhere and watched.  It is SO SO good.</p>

<p>Anyway, a buddy of mine sends me some pretty cool movie lists and listed on one of them was a movie titled Cronocrimines aka Timecrimes, directed by Nacho Vigalondo. The description was super vague but it was listed as one of the best time travel movies of recent memories.</p>

<p>And boy is it.</p>

<p>This movie is bonkers! It starts out pretty slow, a dude comes home to his wife and their new house and takes a nap. He wakes up and thinks he sees a naked chick in the woods beyond the fence of his backyard. He grabs some binoculars to double-check. Yes, yes it is indeed a naked woman.  Then he sees another figure with its head completely wrapped in blood-soaked bandages. I can’t go into detail after that but what transpires is the most fun I’ve had watching a movie since being surround by like-minded 90s people watching Dope. </p>

<p>I found myself at multiple times just saying, “No f@#king way! What?!” Mostly out of appreciation for what the movie does not just for the casual viewer but for the film student. I’ve written about screenwriting techniques Before and have a true appreciation for a good screenplay and this film has one.  Timecrimes is in Spanish and called Cronocrimines originally and there are subtitles but Amazon has the dubbed version while VUDU has the original Spanish version.  I suggest the subtitles if you can handle it.</p>

<p>This movie is so twisty and turny and was such a pleasant surprise to watch. There are only four characters but because of the time travel that number is always morphing. This flick was so much fun. Check it out. But DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILERS! Super spoilers! I’m glad I came into that movie knowing nothing about it. Check it out.</p></article>
